# MultiHop-Question-Answering
Report for the project "MultiHop Question Answering" (May 2018 - Feb 2019), done as a Creative Engineering Project (ID4100, IIT Madras). Work done under the guidance of Dr. Mitesh M. Khapra at IIT Madras.  

## Description
The aim of this project is to ideate about and implement a deep learning model to tackle a largely active topic in natural language processing - the task of question answering, more specifically, **multi-hop** question answering. We present extensive results and analysis on the [WIKIHOP dataset](http://qangaroo.cs.ucl.ac.uk/), and preliminary results on the [HOTPOTQA dataset](https://hotpotqa.github.io/).

## Designed model for WIKIHOP
